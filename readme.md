# Group 2 Project  ![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")
Our goal its to make a metric program that able to show the user the metrics of a website or a file. It will
tell the use the amount of lines code and text. It will tell the user what kind of operators are present when the program is a java, c or a c++ file.
The user will then be given in a app window the metrics of their dataColected based on the file that they upload.
provided. This application will work with both Mac and Windows machines.
> The program will allow the user to link a website(like a github file) or input a local file into the program
and then it will give the user the options to select what kind of metric they would like to see. The options we have to far are
word count, line count, character count, comment line count and source line count. The program will show the user in a GUI interface and a pie chart of what data it has gathered.

# Software Requirements Specification
**Table of Contents**
1. **Introduction**

   **1.1** Purpose

      The purpose of this SRS document is to provide a detailed overview of our metrics software. This SRS will cover all aspects of the software.
      Our intended audience includes other developers and users who may find these contents useful.

   **1.2** Intended Audience

      While anyone is free to use this program, our target audience includes primarily software developers.

   **1.3** Scope

      Our goal is to deliver a platform in which users can get metrics of a file and are able to use this
      information in a easy and productive way.

2. **Overview**

   **2.1** Product Functions

      Our software will allow users to change the way that they check for metrics and information in their upload files or website. This will allow the user
      to do what they find fit with the info provided.
   
   **2.2** Definitions

   Some terms in the SRS may be referred to via acronym, so we will be pre-defining any here.

      GUI - Graphic User Interface

      SLOC - Source Lines of Code

      DIT - Depth of Inheritance

      CC - Cyclomatic Complexity

      MI - Maintainability Index

   ...
   
   **2.3** Product Constraints

      - Time frame for completion: Approzimately 7 weeks
      - //list more...

3. **External Interface Requirements**

      **3.1** User Interfaces

      The GUI makes it much more user friendly to input a file or website than when using the program through a command line.
      The metrics are also placed in boxes making it much easier for the user to see what their file/url has.

4. **System Features**

   **4.1** GUI

      **4.1.1** Description and Priority

      A fully functioning GUI that allows user to get metrics from a file or a website with ease.
      The program will then relay this information to the GUI and user will be able to observe the data colected
      from their inputted source.


      **4.1.2** Stimulus/Response Sequences


      **4.1.3** Functional Requirements

5. **Other Non-Functional Requirements**
