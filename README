This will serve as the main documentation for group 2 and all the group members from group two will add to this file
as need be. This is where our final commits will go as well as our design documentation and any other formal forms
of changes that we add into the final project. We will upload our progress into this file as well to keep track of the
development of the group project. We will periodically update code using git and using V.C within our I.D.E's in order
to ensure our work is constantly updated between our group to ensure there are very little issues with regards to code
compatibility.

For this project we have decided on making a desktop application with our existing metric program. This will include a
GUI, and a launching mechanism whether its from a shortcut or some sort of launching application. The user will be able
insert a piece of code and or text and the program will give them the metrics of their program. This includes, but is
not limited to the numbers of characters, lines, spaces and check the type of text/code it is. The program will then
display the results to the user and give them the metrics in a information box. The information will have the ability
to be copied or cleared, if the user chooses to clear the code, the program will reset itself so it will prompt the user
to re-enter a file to be examined. With making an G.U.I for the metric program it will be scalable for other user to use
as far as functionality is concerned. We plan on using the controller class as well as the general G.U.I function with
the use of java U.I function.

We've added in our git ignore file which allowed us to push and merge much easier since we we're getting a merge error.
The program will take in two git repos and will allow uses to compare the two together on a pie chart.
